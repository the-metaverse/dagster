"""Unit and pipeline tests for the airline_demo.

As is common in real-world pipelines, we want to test some fairly heavy-weight operations,
requiring, e.g., a connection to S3, Spark, and a database.

We lever pytest marks to isolate subsets of tests with different requirements. E.g., to run only
those tests that don't require Spark, `pytest -m "not spark"`.

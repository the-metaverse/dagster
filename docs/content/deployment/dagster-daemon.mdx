# Dagster Daemon

Several Dagster features, like [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), and [run queueing](/deployment/run-coordinator#limiting-run-concurrency), require a long-running `dagster-daemon` process to be included with your deployment.

To start the `dagster-daemon` process locally, launch the following command in the same folder as your [`workspace.yaml`](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces#workspace-yaml) file and keep the process running:

```shell
$ dagster-daemon run
```

Check the [Deployment Guides](/deployment#hands-on-guides-to-deploying-dagster) section for more information on how to deploy the daemon in other environments, like Docker or Kubernetes.

## Available daemons

The `dagster-daemon` process reads from your [Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance) file to determine which daemons it should include. Each of those daemons then runs on a regular interval in its own threads. Daemons that need to load your workspace will periodically reload the workspace from your `workspace.yaml` file. If you change your `workspace.yaml` file, you do not need to reload the `dagster-daemon` process in order for those changes to be included.

The following daemons are currently available:

- The _scheduler daemon_ is responsible for creating runs from any [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) that are turned on. This daemon will run as long as you have not overridden the default <PyObject module="dagster.core.scheduler" object="DagsterDaemonScheduler" /> as the scheduler on your instance.

- The _run queue daemon_ is responsible for launching queued runs, taking into account any limits and prioritization rules you've set on your instance. You can enable this daemon by setting the [run coordinator](/deployment/run-coordinator) on your instance to <PyObject module="dagster.core.run_coordinator" object="QueuedRunCoordinator" />.

- The _sensor daemon_ is responsible for creating runs from any [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) that are turned on. This daemon is always enabled.

- The _run monitoring daemon_ is responsible for handling run worker failures. This daemon can be enabled with the [`run_monitoring`](/deployment/run-monitoring) field in your instance.

## Daemons in Dagit

To check the status of your `dagster-daemon` process within Dagit, click on "Status" in the left nav. This will take you a page where you can see information about each daemon that's currently configured on your instance.

Each daemon periodically writes a heartbeat to your instance storage, so if a daemon doesn't show a recent heartbeat on this page, it likely indicates that you should check the logs from your `dagster-daemon` process for errors.
